# Suture Thread Reconstruction Dataset and Codebase
Suture Thread Reconstruction Dataset and Codebase

**This repo will soon be updated with the codebase used for the improved version of our method, detailed in the paper ["Autonomous Image-to-Grasp Robotic Suturing Using Reliability-Driven Suture Thread Reconstruction"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16938)**

This github repo contains the image datasets and codebase for the ICRA2023 paper entitled:
["Suture Thread Spline Reconstruction from Endoscopic Images for Robotic Surgery with Reliability-driven Keypoint Detection"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10161539)
